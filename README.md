#Be sure that this project goes Along with your Local laws as it does for me as long as im not putting Boompaste into this.
#NEVER USE AN OLD PULSE-GENERATOR FOR RADAR FLIGHT GUIDIANCE and mapping FROM JETS SINCE YOU GONNA BE ASAP RADAR IDENTIFIED AS POSSIBLE ENEMY THAT GONNA BE EXPENSIVE BUDDY. 
#In my opinion do that only at Desert etc, as you dont want to hurt anyone, even tho its not containing explosives, its heavy power brutal enough to wreck something by just -----flying through it.
-this will be designed to start 2, seconds after lock-on since any engine faster than that would be expensive as hell.
-probably gonna do 30-40KM before running out of fuel, which differs a lot  
- do not use 3d print as its getting wrecked out already at start and will have an awful aerodynamic movement

-If you shooting at your drone keep in mind its probably just getting thrashed by flying through instantly loosing its targed, make sure missile isnt landing anywhere unsafe.
-Im gonna ad a safetyhead which autoavoids landing at warm organics as animals or humans.
-the finished software will be about many GB,s as i need to at multiple safety layers.
-CNC Files will be done at some point by an more Aerodynamic proffessional than me , you can like use old ones but all those software is encrypted as hell so dont -mess with that , asweel any motorguide before 2002 will have a high chance of mid flight failure as i cant provide detailed area mappings here we wont need that by just ----------building the map itself , wich you can do per drone but also via Naval Radar 


  -also take a look at you Local frequency allowance list , since you dont want to interrupt Radar or other Military stuff, im gonna adding a module that ensures that soon.
  - You can use original hydrogen / Hydrocarbon Fuel for this but i wouldn recommend since this getting really expensive ,
  - if your planning for An intercept with target above 900km/h you need a some High Frequency Parts how can be expensive, so best way is to get them out of old
    demilitarised ones. 
- as for HF wave guide, [PEWAN1136](https://www.digikey.de/de/products/detail/pasternack/PEWAN1136/22163835?) this 95-100Ghz PEWAN1136 is good enough if you not want going -   - above Sonicspeed but in order to Keep a proper lock on you should also go with 50GHZ,120GHZ,180GHZ,300GHZ so The Target finder can follow everything much more easy aswell as switch to AI if flares are used



# AntiAir-HeatseekerMissileSystem
An Actual Open Source Heat seeking missile system , sounds crazy hm? 
yep, you very own safe Airspace.
